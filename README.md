# Go_Socket
A file upload client and a looping (multiple upload) server.
I worked on and uploaded the assignment in sections, with each one adding a new functionality to the project. 
I didn't end up uploading PA1.go, as it was just a file where I learned the basic functionality of Go. (Print statements, how to read and write to files, etc.)

# What does each part do?
PA2 is about accessing files input by the user.
PA3 is a file upload client that can connect to a server and send and receive messages back and forth.
PA4 is a file upload server that listens on a specified port # for requests and connects to the client.
PA5 is just a small extension of P4 that allows the file upload service to continue forever even if the client is closed and reopened.

# Possible future functionality: 
- Create concurrent server that allows for simultaneous uploads
- Build web request interpreter
– Build web response sender
– Add web server security
